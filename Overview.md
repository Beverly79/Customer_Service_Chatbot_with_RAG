# **Customer Service Chatbot with RAG**

## **Project Overview**
Build a Q&A chatbot that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to customer queries. The chatbot dynamically retrieves domain-specific knowledge and integrates it with a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate responses.

### **Key Features**
- **RAG Integration:** Combines vector-based knowledge retrieval with LLMs for dynamic and accurate query responses.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Optimized prompts to improve response quality by effectively utilizing retrieved knowledge.
- **Interactive Demo:** A user-friendly interface to showcase real-time chatbot functionality.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS for document retrieval.
- **LLM Backend:** Open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA or similar) integrated with prompt engineering.
- **Embedding Models:** OpenAI embeddings or Sentence Transformers for document and query vectorization.
- **Frontend:** Streamlit for a web-based interface or CLI for lightweight interaction.
- **Programming Language:** Python.

### **Outcome**
- A GitHub-hosted project with:
  - Complete source code.
  - Interactive demo (web or CLI-based).
  - Documentation explaining implementation details and usage.

### **Applications**
- Customer support automation for e-commerce, insurance, and other industries.
- Q&A systems for internal company knowledge bases.
- Scalable and updatable retrieval-based chatbot solutions.
